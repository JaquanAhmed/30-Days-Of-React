    1. Variables
        - var, let and const difference:
            - https://www.developer.com/languages/javascript/javascript-var-let-const-variable-declaration/
            - var is not used much anymore
            - var is function scoped
            - let and const is block scoped
            - const should be used when variable doesn't need to be changed
            - const object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated
            - var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope
            - let variables can be updated but not re-declared
            - const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared
            - They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized
            - While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration
    3. Arrays
        - You can create arrays the following two ways
            - const arr = Array()
            - const arr = [] 
                - This is the recomended way to create empty arrays
            - 'array name' .length will give number of items in array
            - .split( ) splits strings into an array of items
            - to get last item in array type 'array name'.length - 1
            - Array() = creates an empty array
            - fill() = fills array with static elements
                - for example Array(8),fill('X') creates an array with 8 X's
            - concat() = combines two arrays
                - array you want to appear first .concat(array you want to appear after first)
            - indexOf() = checks if an item exists if it does it returns where it is within the array. If it doesn't it returns -1
            - lastIndexOf() = it gives the position of the last time the item is in the array
            - includes() = checks if item exists in array // boolean
            - isArray() = checks if the data type is an array // boolean
            - toString() = converts to string
            - join() = will convert the array to string with the inputed parameter as the connector
            - slice() = create an array with a part of another array
            - splice() = It takes three parameters:Starting position, number of times to be removed and number of items to be added.
            - Push() = add an item to the end of an array
            - pop() = remove an item at the end of an array
            - shift() = remove an item at the beginning of an array
            - unshift() = add an item to the beginning of an array
            - reverse() = reverse array
            - sort() = sort array into alphabetical order
            - you can store arrays within arrays.
