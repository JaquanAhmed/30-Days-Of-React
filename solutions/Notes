Day 1
    1. Variables
        - var, let and const difference:
            - https://www.developer.com/languages/javascript/javascript-var-let-const-variable-declaration/
            - var is not used much anymore
            - var is function scoped
            - let and const is block scoped
            - const should be used when variable doesn't need to be changed
            - const object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated
            - var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope
            - let variables can be updated but not re-declared
            - const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared
            - They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized
            - While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration

    3. Arrays
        - You can create arrays the following two ways
            - const arr = Array()
            - const arr = [] 
                - This is the recomended way to create empty arrays
        - 'array name' .length will give number of items in array
        - .split( ) splits strings into an array of items
        - to get last item in array type 'array name'.length - 1
        - Array() = creates an empty array
        - fill() = fills array with static elements
            - for example Array(8),fill('X') creates an array with 8 X's
        - concat() = combines two arrays
            - array you want to appear first .concat(array you want to appear after first)
        - indexOf() = checks if an item exists if it does it returns where it is within the array. If it doesn't it returns -1
        - lastIndexOf() = it gives the position of the last time the item is in the array
        - includes() = checks if item exists in array // boolean
        - isArray() = checks if the data type is an array // boolean
        - toString() = converts to string
        - join() = will convert the array to string with the inputed parameter as the connector
        - slice() = create an array with a part of another array
        - splice() = It takes three parameters:Starting position, number of times to be removed and number of items to be added.
        - Push() = add an item to the end of an array
        - pop() = remove an item at the end of an array
        - shift() = remove an item at the beginning of an array
        - unshift() = add an item to the beginning of an array
        - reverse() = reverse array
        - sort() = sort array into alphabetical order
        - you can store arrays within arrays.
        - Remove Punctuation from string
            - replace(/[.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=\-_`~()]/g,"")
            - If their are crazy spaces between words because of the removed Punctuation.
                - replace(/\s{2,}/g," ");
        - To export stuff you have to make them a global variable (var)
            - Use export {name of variable};
            - import using import { name of variable } from "./file.js";
                -add more . before / to go back more folders
        - to check if variable is undefined use typeof

    4. Conditions
        - Conditions can be implementing using the following ways:
                - if
                - if else
                - if else if else
                - switch
                - ternary operator
        - Switch is an alternative for if else if else else
            - Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value. 
            - The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied. 
            - The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.
        - Ternary operator is very common in React
            - It is a short way to write if else statement.
            
    5. Loops
        - Regular for loop can be used anywhere when the number of iteration is known.
        - While loop when the number of iteration is not know
        - Do while loop and while loop are almost the same but do while loop run at least once even when the condition is false
        - 'for of' used like java for each
            - used to iterate through arrays
        - 'for each' is similar to 'for of' but you need to also define the index number as well as the array itself sometimes
        - 'for in' is used for objects

    6. Scope
        - Variable scopes can be:
            - Windowed
            - Global
            - Local
